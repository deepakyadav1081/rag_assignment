  "query": "What percentage of Google's 2023 revenue came from advertising?",
  "answer": "To determine the percentage of Google's 2023 revenue that came from advertising, we need to calculate the total revenue from advertising and the total revenue for 2023. \n\nThe total revenue from advertising is not directly provided, but we can calculate the revenue from advertising for each segment:\n\n- YouTube ads revenue: $2.3 billion\n- Google Network revenue: $1.5 billion decrease, but the actual revenue is not provided. However, we can infer that the revenue from Google Network is a significant portion of Google's total revenue, as it is a major segment.\n\nSince the exact revenue from Google Network is not provided, we cannot calculate the exact percentage of revenue from advertising. However, we can estimate it based on the information provided.\n\nAssuming that the revenue from Google Network is a significant portion of Google's total revenue, and considering the growth in YouTube ads revenue, we can estimate that advertising revenue accounts for at least 70-80% of Google's total revenue.",
